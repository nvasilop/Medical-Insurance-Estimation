This is a Codecademy project!

I examined how factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, and smoking status contribute to medical insurance costs.
I defined as age: age of the individual in years, as sex: 0 for female, 1 for male, as bmi: individual’s body mass index, as num_of_children: number of children the individual has, as smoker: 0 for a non-smoker, 1 for a smoker. 
I used the following formula to estimate an individual’s insurance cost (in USD): insurance_cost=250∗age−128∗sex +370∗bmi+425∗num_of_children +24000∗smoker−12500
​
I have created a function to estimate insurance costs and then used it to calculate the estimated insurance costs for a few individuals. 
Additionally, I have managed and compared actual and estimated insurance cost data using lists. 
Overall, I used Python lists, Python functions and append method.
